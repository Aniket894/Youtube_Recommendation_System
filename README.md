# YouTube Video Recommendation System - Advanced Documentation

## 1. Introduction
### Overview
The YouTube Video Recommendation System is designed to enhance user engagement by suggesting relevant videos based on user preferences. This project implements two major recommendation techniques:
- **Popularity-Based Recommendation**
- **Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommendation**

The system uses real-world YouTube trending videos data to build and test the recommendation model.

### Objectives
- To develop an effective video recommendation model.
- To compare popularity-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
- To evaluate performance using similarity measures and user interaction data.

## 2. System Architecture
### High-Level Design
The recommendation system follows these steps:
1. **Data Collection** - Fetch YouTube trending videos dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Extract relevant features for recommendation.
4. **Recommendation Model** - Implement both popularity-based and collaborative filtering methods.
5. **Evaluation** - Measure the effectiveness of recommendations.


## 3. Data Collection & Preprocessing
### Data Source
- The dataset is downloaded from **Kaggle** (`canerkonuk/youtube-trending-videos-global`).
- The dataset contains metadata of trending YouTube videos across various countries.

### Preprocessing Steps
- Handling missing values.
- Converting categorical data into numerical representations.
- Normalizing numerical features for model training.
- Extracting relevant features (e.g., views, likes, comments).

## 4. Model Selection & Training
### Popularity-Based Recommendation
- Suggests videos based on overall engagement metrics (e.g., highest views, likes).
- Does not personalize recommendations.

### Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommendation
- **User-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Uses similarity between users' viewing behavior to suggest videos.
- **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends videos similar to those a user has watched.
- **Cosine Similarity** is used to measure similarity between items.
- The system uses a sparse matrix representation to improve efficiency.

## 5. Implementation Details
### Libraries Used
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data processing.
- **Scikit-learn** for similarity calculations.
- **Scipy** for sparse matrix operations.
- **Kaggle API** for dataset retrieval.

### Code Structure
1. **Data Loading** - Reads dataset and structures it.
2. **Preprocessing** - Cleans and prepares data.
3. **Recommendation Model**
   - Popularity-based: Ranks videos by views.
   - Collaborative filtering: Calculates similarity scores.
4. **Evaluation** - Validates recommendations.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
### Metrics Used
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures closeness between video features.
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluates how well recommendations match actual user preferences.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures prediction accuracy for collaborative filtering.


## 7. Future Enhancements
- **Hybrid Model**: Combining popularity and collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.
- **Deep Learning Approaches**: Using neural networks for better feature extraction.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Updating recommendations dynamically based on user activity.

## 8. Conclusion
This project successfully implements a YouTube Video Recommendation System using both popularity-based and collaborative filtering techniques. Further improvements can be made by integrating real-time data and deep learning approaches to enhance recommendation quality.
